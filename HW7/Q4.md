### Interpretation of the Regression Model

#### Intercept:
The intercept is **32.00974**. This represents the predicted value of `y` when `x` is 0.  
In the context of the problem, when `x` is 0, `y` is expected to be approximately **32.01**.  
The units of the intercept are the same as the units of `y`.

#### Slope:
The slope is **5.113636**. This represents the change in `y` for each one-unit increase in `x`.  
In the context of the problem, for every additional unit of `x`, `y` increases by approximately **5.11**.  
The units of the slope are the units of `y` per unit of `x`.
